# Update Workflow Guide

This directory stores the source update manifest, the published update feed contract, and per-release changelogs for the app updater.

## Files

- `manifest.json`: the manually maintained source manifest. Edit this file only.
- `stable.json`: generated from `manifest.json` by `./gradlew syncStableManifest` to avoid manual sync mistakes.
- `changelogs/{versionCode}.changelog`: the GitHub Release body for a specific release, for example `changelogs/1.changelog`.

`update/changelogs` is the single source of truth. During the app build, Gradle stages only
`1.changelog` as the fallback and the current version's changelog under generated Compose resources;
generated copies must not be committed under `composeApp/src`.

The source repository versions of `manifest.json` and `stable.json` must always keep:

```json
{
  "isReady": false,
  "assets": []
}
```

The source manifest must not contain `releaseUrl`. The ready manifest consumed by app clients is generated temporarily by the workflow only after APK build, signing, and upload complete. It is not committed back to `main`.

## Release Android APK Workflow

Workflow file:

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`

Trigger:

- Run `Release Android APK` manually from the GitHub Actions page.
- The workflow creates the tag named after `update/manifest.json` `versionCode`.
- If that tag already exists, it must point to the current commit.

Manual preparation before release:

1. Update `yamiboAppVersionCode` and `yamiboAppVersionName` in `composeApp/build.gradle.kts`.
2. Update `update/manifest.json`, keeping `isReady=false`, `assets=[]`, and no `releaseUrl`.
3. Add or update `update/changelogs/{versionCode}.changelog`.
4. Run locally:

```powershell
.\gradlew syncStableManifest validateUpdateManifest --console=plain
```

Trigger the release:

1. Push the prepared release commit to the source repository.
2. Open GitHub Actions.
3. Select `Release Android APK`.
4. Click `Run workflow`.

Workflow steps:

1. Check out the selected source branch.
2. Validate the manifest, app version, and matching changelog.
3. Create and push the `versionCode` release tag, or verify that an existing tag points to the current commit.
4. Run `syncStableManifest validateUpdateManifest`, requiring the source manifest to remain `isReady=false`.
5. Build the release APK.
6. Zipalign, sign, and verify the APK with `mine.keystore`.
7. Create or update the GitHub Release.
8. Upload the APK asset.
9. Calculate the APK `sha256` and `size`.
10. Upload the same APK to the Gitee and Gitea release assets.
11. Generate target-specific published update folders in runner temp:
   - `isReady=true`
   - `releaseUrl`
   - APK asset `url`, `sha256`, and `size`
   - `releaseNotes` and `changelogs/{versionCode}.changelog` from the matching source changelog
   - identical `manifest.json` and `stable.json`
12. Run `validatePublishedUpdateManifest` for each target folder.
13. Force push the GitHub-targeted `update` folder to the GitHub `update-release` branch.
14. Force push the Gitee-targeted and Gitea-targeted `update` folders to their mirror repositories.

Important asset URL rule:

- GitHub `update-release` manifests must use the GitHub Release APK URL.
- Gitee mirror manifests must use the Gitee Release APK URL.
- Gitea mirror manifests must use the Gitea Release APK URL.
- Do not publish mirror manifests that point back to GitHub APK assets.

Client update source order (all serve the same GitHub `lmc2007/yamibo-app` feed; mirrors are preferred for speed, GitHub direct is the last fallback):

1. `github.cnxiaobai.com` mirror
2. `gh.halonice.com` mirror
3. `ghproxy.sakuramoe.dev` mirror
4. `gh.padao.fun` mirror
5. `gh.jasonzeng.dev` mirror
6. `ghproxy.mirror.skybyte.me` mirror
7. GitHub direct: `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../update-release/update/stable.json`

Update-check timeouts: each proxy source uses a 5 second request timeout; GitHub direct uses 10 seconds.

The download proxies are not used for update checks; they only accelerate APK downloads. The user picks the download mode in the App update screen: GitHub direct, or mirror proxy (default). In proxy mode, Android downloads of GitHub Release APK assets go through the selected proxy (`https://gh-proxy.com/<asset-url>` / `https://ghproxy.net/<asset-url>` / `https://gh.dpik.top/<asset-url>`) first and fall back to the GitHub direct URL when the proxy fails; in direct mode only the GitHub URL is used. `gh.dpik.top` is the default proxy node used by the `github.akams.cn` frontend (that site itself does not serve prefix-proxy requests). The client automatically falls back to the next source when one fails to fetch or decode, and skips stale mirrors (ready manifests not newer than the installed version) instead of stopping at them.

## Sync Update Folder To Mirrors Workflow

Workflow file:

- `.github/workflows/sync-update-mirrors.yml`

Trigger:

- Run `Sync Update Folder To Mirrors` manually from the GitHub Actions page.

Input:

- `use_latest_release_asset=false`: default. Syncs the source `update/manifest.json` and `stable.json`, meaning `isReady=false`. Use this to pause public updates or reset the public feed to a not-ready state.
- `use_latest_release_asset=true`: reads the GitHub Release APK matching the current `manifest.versionCode`, regenerates an `isReady=true` published manifest, and syncs it to the GitHub `update-release` branch plus Gitee and Gitea mirrors.

Default sync flow:

1. Check out the source repo.
2. Run `syncStableManifest validateUpdateManifest`.
3. If `stable.json` was regenerated, commit it back to the source repo.
4. Copy source `update/manifest.json` and `stable.json` into runner temp.
5. Force push the temp `update` folder to the GitHub `update-release` branch.
6. Force push the temp `update` folder to the Gitee and Gitea mirror repositories.

`use_latest_release_asset=true` flow:

1. Check out the source repo.
2. Run `syncStableManifest validateUpdateManifest`.
3. Read `manifest.versionCode`, `versionName`, and `channel`.
4. Download the matching APK from GitHub Releases:

```text
yamibo-{channel}-v{versionName}.apk
```

5. Calculate the APK `sha256` and `size`.
6. Upload/copy that APK into Gitee and Gitea release assets.
7. Generate target-specific `isReady=true` published manifests:
   - GitHub manifest uses the GitHub release asset URL.
   - Gitee manifest uses the Gitee release asset URL.
   - Gitea manifest uses the Gitea release asset URL.
8. Run `validatePublishedUpdateManifest` for each ready folder.
9. Force push the ready GitHub `update` folder to the GitHub `update-release` branch.
10. Force push the ready Gitee/Gitea `update` folders to their mirror repositories.

## Manual Ready Update Manifests Workflow

Workflow file:

- `.github/workflows/manual-ready.yml`

Trigger:

- Run `Manual Ready Update Manifests` manually from the GitHub Actions page.

Purpose:

- Use this when APK releases already exist but the published update feeds need to be marked ready.
- The workflow reads the current `update/manifest.json` version, downloads the matching GitHub Release APK, uploads/copies it into Gitee and Gitea release assets, then publishes `isReady=true` manifests to GitHub, Gitee, and Gitea.
- Like the release and sync workflows, mirror manifests must point to their own mirror release asset URL rather than GitHub's APK URL.

## Which Workflow To Use

- Prepare a new version (recommended): run `Prepare Version Update` manually — enter the version number; it updates version files, generates the changelog, validates, commits, and pushes. Optionally tick `trigger_release_after` to start the release workflow right after.
- Normal release: run `Release Android APK` manually from GitHub Actions (on the same branch that `Prepare Version Update` pushed to).
- Update feed did not sync correctly after a release: run `Sync Update Folder To Mirrors` manually with `use_latest_release_asset=true`.
- APK assets already exist and only the public feeds should become ready: run `Manual Ready Update Manifests`.
- A released APK has a problem and app-side update prompts should be paused: run `Sync Update Folder To Mirrors` manually with `use_latest_release_asset=false`.

## Release Safety Rules

- Do not manually set source `manifest.json` or `stable.json` to `isReady=true`.
- Do not manually add APK assets to the source manifest.
- Do not manually add `releaseUrl` to the source manifest.
- `isReady=true` should exist only in the published update folder on the GitHub `update-release` branch and the Gitee/Gitea mirror repositories.
- The app client shows an available update and downloads the APK only when it reads `isReady=true` and the remote version is newer.
